== To be discussed ==

  * free layout page style

== To be verified ==

  * query openid from email
  * Top page introduction block (slide down from header)
    * Top page introduction block content: Random user avatars
  * Add-on group change: new user / pro user / general
  * changing avatar is not quite discoverable.
  * name < 3

=== Header behavior ===

  # Always open 「了解本站」 at state 0 (not logged in)
    # We would like to trick users to scroll down to see everything; the height of first block (features) almost finished at the bottom edge of visible part, users might not able to aware there are more down there.
    # yet the block might be annoying to page builders, if so the block should always open on top page, with non-invasive speech bubble points to 「了解本站」 button after DOM load.
  # 「更多...」 Always closed at state 1,2 (login user with or without page)
    # something more to stuck into the block?

This behavior is due to the fact header block does not know which page it is on without loading javascript, and *show up something after DOM ready is really annoying (i think)*
  * Any behavior plan that breaks this fragment caching scheme is required to make substantial change to the caching system.

= Future Ideas =

  * Add one-line-comment on add-ons one suggest (alicekey)
  * User similarity block on user pages
  * Personal page as identity
     - user can optionally add open id meta tags
     - but if one add it's meta tag, then the url can never be changed and will be reserved even if one delete its own account.
  * tagging game for the addons (bobchao)
